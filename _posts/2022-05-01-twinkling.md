Stars are twinkling. Any of us can observe this phenomenon by looking at a clear night sky:
stars seem to quickly change of apparent brightness, colour or even position. This is what
is described as twinkling. In fact, the origin of this phenomenon is not related to the stars
themselves but rather to the medium in which their light propagates at the end of their
long journey through space: our atmosphere.

# Origin: scintillation
As a matter of fact, our atmosphere
is made of air that does not
have the same properties everywhere
and at all instants. Indeed, a parcel of
air can be described by several quantities,
such as its pressure or its temperature,
and variations of these quantities
over large areas lead to motions
of air (i.e. wind). However, fluctuations
of pressure or temperature
(and thus air motions) can also happen
at small scale, arising from turbulence
in the atmosphere. This implies
that characteristics of the medium in
which the light is travelling are locally
varying, modifying the light trajectory.

Compare our atmosphere to a
swimming pool in which there is a
small coin (depicting the star): looking
through the water, the coin position
seems to wobble from side to
side. This is because the water of
the pool bends the light coming from
the coin (this phenomenon is called
refraction) and the wobbling originates
from water motion. In fact, this
is exactly what happens to the light
of stars in our atmosphere. Scientists
have named "scintillation" this physical
phenomenon behind the twinkling
of stars.

# Scientific interests
Astronomers do not like scintillation
as this reduces the quality of
ground-based observations. However,
astronomers are not the only one to
suffer from scintillation, electrical and optical engineers
also struggle with this phenomenon,
especially for ground to
satellite communications. The situation
is similar: think of the satellite
as a star that is sending data towards
Earth and that can also receive data
sent from Earth. In a general sense,
the information is encoded on electromagnetic
waves (such as the light or
the waves used for mobile communications)
that also travel through our
challenging atmosphere. Scintillation
damages the received waves, making
it harder or even impossible to recover
the sent information. This comparison
is even more true today since
optical waves (i.e. light) are getting
interest for ground to satellite communications.
Nevertheless, scintillation influences
any electromagnetic waves and
the study of its effects for telecommunication
is part of a broader
goal: the characterization of communication
channels (i.e. the medium
in which the waves are propagating).
Based on observations, measurements
and models, the main interest
of astronomers and engineers is to
predict and measure scintillation effects,
either to compensate them (if
possible) or to avoid them by delaying
the communication or the astronomical
observation period.
