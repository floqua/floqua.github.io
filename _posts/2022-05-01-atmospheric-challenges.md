In their fascinating quest of observing the universe, astronomers are facing gargantuan challenges such as the *faintness* of distant space objects, the *blindness* arising from absorption in nebulae (i.e. gas clouds) or even *light pollution* from human activities. But in fact, one of the biggest of these challenges is also the closest to us: the Earth's atmosphere and its associated *blurriness*.
