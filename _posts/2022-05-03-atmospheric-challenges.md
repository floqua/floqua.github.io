In their fascinating quest of observing the universe, astronomers are facing gargantuan challenges such as the *faintness* of distant objects, the *blindness* arising from absorption in nebulae (i.e. gas clouds) or even *light pollution* from human activities. And one of the biggest of these challenges is also the closest to us: the Earth's atmosphere and its associated *blurriness*.


# Atmospheric turbulence
Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere are associated to local fluctuations of physical quantities such as the pressure, the temperature and the humidity. In turn, their variations lead to fluctuation of the refractive index. **+ eq. refractive index from p,T,...**
Relate to post about scintillation (make link?)...
